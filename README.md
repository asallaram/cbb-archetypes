# üèÄ College Basketball Archetypes

## Abstract

Team success in college basketball is based not only on the talent available on a team, but also on how players complement one another within a lineup. While advanced metrics exist for evaluating individual performance, less attention has been paid to how different player archetypes interact within a team structure. This project introduces a method for evaluating lineups based on the roles and archetypes of the players within them and the interactions seen. By analyzing offensive and defensive efficiency metrics across various team compositions, this study aims to identify which archetype combinations yield the highest performance. It also explores how teams match up against each other based on archetypal builds and differences. Unlike approaches that focus solely on raw talent or position, this largely is focused on efficiency ‚Äî how a passing point guard might elevate a lob-threat power forward more than a shooting one, or how archetypal diversity within a lineup can influence matchup outcomes. These insights can inform coaching strategies and lineup optimization, offering another useful approach to building successful teams.
