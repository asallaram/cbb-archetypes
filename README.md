# College Basketball and its Archetypes
College basketball often garners much fewer viewers than its professional counterpart, the NBA. Understandably so, the level of play and the entertainment of high-skilled professional players in the NBA has long attracted media sponsors, the general American populace, and more increasingly: global fans. However, in recent years fans have questioned the lack of excitement in the game and feel as if the game has turned into a 3-pt shooting fest that often leads to little physicality and entertainment. I believe College Basketball could be an alternative for basketball fans and be even more exciting than the NBA.
