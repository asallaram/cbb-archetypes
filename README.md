# College Basketball Archetypes

This project seeks to define how a team's players interact with one another in terms of their individual archetypes. Specifically, it examines:

- How different archetypes function within a team’s lineup.
- Which lineups are the most efficient based on player archetypes.
- How teams match up against each other based on their archetypal compositions.

By analyzing these factors, we can gain insights into how certain player combinations contribute to a team’s overall success. This project aims to explore whether particular archetypes lead to stronger team performance, how teams optimize their lineups, and how different playstyles impact matchups. The findings could be useful for coaches, analysts, and fans looking to understand the strategic side of team-building in college basketball.

Future areas of exploration may include expanding the dataset across multiple seasons, refining the classification of player archetypes, and using predictive models to assess the effectiveness of various lineup configurations.
