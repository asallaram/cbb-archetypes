# College Basketball Archetypes

This project seeks to define how a team's players interact with one another in terms of their individual archetypes. Specifically, it examines:

- How different archetypes function within a team’s lineup (i.e. does team A function better with a passing point guard and a shooting power forward compared to a passing point guard and lob threat power forward).
- Which lineups are the most efficient based on player archetypes. (i.e. team A with the lob threat power forward performs much better offensively and defensively as compared to the shooting power forward in the line-up. 
- How teams match up against each other based on their archetypal compositions.

By analyzing these factors, we can gain insights into how certain player combinations contribute to a team’s overall success. This project aims to explore whether particular archetypes lead to stronger team performance, how teams optimize their lineups, and how different playstyles impact matchups. The findings also seek to predict how a team could improve their future line-ups, transfer portal and recruiting, based on coach tendencies, returning players, and player improvement.
